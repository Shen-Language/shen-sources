## [Unreleased]

## [21.0] - 2018-02-17

### Added
- Moved code that prints errors at the toplevel to the `shen.toplevel-display-exception` function that can be overrided by ports to customize printing of errors (to for example, include error location).

### Removed
- `command-line` function and `*argv*` variable.
- `fold-right` and `fold-left`.
- `get/or`, `value/or`, `<-address/or`, `<-vector/or` and `<-dict/or`.
- `filter`.
- `exit`.
- Handling of EOF in the REPL.

### Changed
- `for-each` was made internal to the `shen` package.
- `dict`, `dict?`, `dict-count`, `dict->`, `<-dict`, `dict-rm`, `dict-fold`, `dict-keys` and `dict-values` made internal to the `shen` package.

### Fixed
- Remove repetition from code generated by `defcc` with made some cases very slow to compile and run.
- Fixed the expansion of non-null packages generated by macros.
- Increased space allocated for prolog, fixes issues in bigger programs.
- Made `,` external.
- Fixes `nth` for cases where the element is not on the list or invalid arguments are passed.

## [20.1] - 2017-05-01

### Added
- `(command-line)` function that returns a list of command line fragments. By default it returns `["shen"]`, ports can override this function or set the value of the `*argv*` variable on startup.

### Fixed
- Fixed `dict-fold`.
- Handle integer overflows in prolog's complexity calculation function. Solves issues in ports with 32bit integers.
- In the 20.0 release, `*sterror*` was not properly set as external in `make.shen`, fixed now.

## [20.0] - 2017-04-23

### Added
- Documentation for system functions (`doc/system-functions.md`).
- Character based I/O, makes Shen work on environments where I/O streams are multibyte encoded (SBCL >= 1.1.2 on Windows).
- Dict datatype with API:
  - `(dict Size)` — returns dictionary object.
  - `(dict? Dict)` — predicate.
  - `(dict-count Dict)` — returns dictionary items count.
  - `(dict-> Dict Key Value)` — stores value.
  - `(<-dict Dict Key)` — retrieves value if it exists or throws an error.
  - `(<-dict/or Dict Key OrDefault)` — like `<-dict` but returns the result of thawing `OrDefault` instead of throwing an error when the key is missing.
  - `(dict-rm Dict Key)` — removes value from a dictionary.
  - `(dict-fold F Dict Acc)` — walks the dictionary, calling `(F Key Value Acc)` for each item in it. The result of each call is the new value of `Acc`, once no more items are left, the final value of `Acc` is returned.
  - `(dict-keys Dict)` — Returns  a list containing all keys in `Dict`.
  - `(dict-values Dict)` — Returns a list containing all values in `Dict`.
- Added `get/or`, `value/or`, `<-address/or` and `<-vector/or`. These work like their `/or`-less counterparts, but accept as an extra argument a continuation (`(freeze ...)`). Whenever their original versions would raise an exception, these variants will instead `thaw` the continuation and return it's result.
- Added `(fold-left F Acc List)`. Calls `(F Acc Elt)` for every `Elt` element in `List`. The result of each call to `F` is used as the new `Acc` for the next call. The final result is the return value of the last call to `F`.
- Added `(fold-right F List Acc)`. Calls `(F Elt Acc)` for every `Elt` element in `List`. The result of each call to `F` is used as the new `Acc` for the next call. The final result is the return value of the last call to `F`.
- Added `(for-each F List)`. Calls `F` on every element of `List` (in order), ignoring the results.
- Added `(filter Predicate List)`. Returns a new lost with all elements to which `(Predicate Elt)` returns true.
- Added `(exit ExitCode)`. Exits the program using the specified error code. The default implementation just ends the REPL loop, ports have to override `exit` if they want the exit code to have any effect.
- Added `*sterror*` and `(sterror)`, STDERR port. Defaults to an alias of `*stoutput*`.
- Added `(read-char-code Stream)`. Reads a character from a stream, and returns its numeric value.
- Added `(read-file-as-charlist Name)`. Reads the contents of a file as a sequence of characters. The result if a list of numeric character codes.

### Changed
- Reader is now built on top of `read-char-code` instead of `read-byte`. As a result, Shen's REPL now works on multibyte environments, like SBCL >= 1.1.2 on Windows.
- Reimplemented `put` and `get` on top of dicts.
- Reimplemented runtime function lookup using `put` and `get`.
- Changed `hash` so that 0 is a valid return value.
- Changed `make.shen` so that 19.2 can correctly compile the new version without needing two passes.
- Ctrl+D (EOF) in the REPL when the line is empty, exits Shen.

### Fixed
- Declared arity for system functions that were missing it.
- Fixed package prefix handling for internal package symbols.
