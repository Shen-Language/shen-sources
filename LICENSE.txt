Comment on BSD, GPL and Copyright

This license applies to all derived versions of Shen, including all versions derived from the sources
provided whatever the method of compilation and the object code generated. This is the reason for
clause 2 in the BSD. Such derived works should carry the above license on those source files
generated â€“ or with the files if they are binary. Any original code specifically written by the
programmer which not derived from the sources supplied is and should be copyrighted to that
programmer. This work may be placed under any license of choice except GPL because of the viral
condition. There is no legal right to relicense or sublicense BSD code or any derived version to
another license (e.g. GPL). The power to place a license on a work belongs to the copyright holder.

A person does not assume copyright over a work by making a small change to it. Only if the change
is substantial to be deemed intellectually significant can such a claim be made and then only over the
change itself. Hence if changing code, if you wish to retain copyright over your changes and they are
intellectually significant, offset these changes under your copyright.
