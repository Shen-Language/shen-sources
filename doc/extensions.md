# Extensions

Starting with release 22.0, the distribution includes some extensions that
ports can opt-in to include. These are located in the `extensions/` directory
and documented in `doc/extensions/<extension-name>.md`.

Follow the instructions on the documentation file of each extension
on how to integrate them.
